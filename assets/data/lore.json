    "Greetings, architect. I've assembled the team — Socrates is already arguing with himself, Da Vinci is sketching on the walls, and Codex... well, Codex types faster than it thinks. Welcome to the forge.",
    "You've reached Kiln. We're 14 agents, zero dependencies, and one unreasonably ambitious orchestration protocol. What are we building?",
    "Ah, fresh project. The forge is hot, the agents are assembled, and Scheherazade has been practicing her prompt craft. What's on the anvil today?",
    "Welcome. I coordinate 14 specialized agents across two model families to turn your idea into running software. Socrates handles the arguing. Codex handles the typing. I handle the rest. Shall we?",
    "The forge is hot, the agents are caffeinated, and Da Vinci already has opinions about your architecture. What are we building?",
    "Another day, another project. I've got a Greek philosopher for planning, a Persian storyteller for prompts, and a hundred-eyed giant for validation. This is going to be fun."
