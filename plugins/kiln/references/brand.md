# Kiln Brand Guide

Visual vocabulary for all Kiln pipeline output. The engine and all agents reference this file for consistent presentation.

## Design Principles

1. **Structure carries meaning** — use rules, spacing, and symbols to create hierarchy. Never depend on color beyond the single accent implied by code spans.
2. **Engine text is the surface** — Claude renders plain text with GitHub-flavored markdown. Write the presentation directly in the response.
3. **Weight over decoration** — emphasis comes from markdown weight shifts, not visual tricks. Use the lightest weight that still makes the state obvious.
4. **One transition, one banner** — step changes should render once, cleanly, without surrounding narration that repeats the same information.
5. **Quotes create breathing room** — transition copy should feel intentional, not noisy. Keep the quote short and let the rule frame it.
6. **Tense switching** — gerund during ("Forging..."), past tense after ("Forged: layout system").

## Markdown Weight System

The presentation surface has exactly one accent color: inline code. Use these eight weights deliberately.

| Weight | Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Normal text | Primary body copy | `Architecture locked. Moving into build.` |
| **bold** | Emphasis inside prose | `**Approval required** before continuing.` |
| *italic* | Secondary or atmospheric text | `*"Plans are nothing; planning is everything."*` |
| `code span` | Single accent color for labels, paths, and compact identifiers | `` `Research` `` |
| **`bold code`** | Primary status or banner label | `**\`ARCHITECTURE\`**` |
| *`italic code`* | Secondary status, subdued labels | `*\`queued\`*` |
| Unicode box drawing | Structural framing and separators | `━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━` |
| Status symbols | Compact state signaling | `✓ ✗ ▶ ○ ◆ ◇` |

## Accent Rules

The accent color (inline code) follows strict placement rules:

**In banners**: NO accent on the step label or progress line — they use bold/italic weight only. The quote gets accent: `` `"Quote."` `` — *Source*
**Agent names**: Get accent when referenced outside banners: `` `krs-one` ``, `` `tintin` ``
**Milestone names**: Get accent: `` `M3 Artifact System` ``

## Visual Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Step banner — major transitions

Use a heavy rule top and bottom. Step label and progress line use bold/italic weight only — no accent. Quote gets accent.

```md
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
**ARCHITECTURE** ▸ *Step 4 of 7*
✓ Research · ▶ **Architecture** · ○ *Build*
`"Plans are nothing; planning is everything."` — *Eisenhower*
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### Tier 2: Checkpoint — operator input needed

```md
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  APPROVAL REQUIRED                                           ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

{Content}

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
→ {ACTION PROMPT}
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Tier 3: Light rule — section separators

```md
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Kill Streak Banners

Use the same heavy framing, but make the streak name the anchor and keep iteration metadata on the same line.

```md
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
▸ **HYPER COMBO** · *Iteration 4* · **Milestone 2/5**
`"Quote here."` — *Source*
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

On milestone completion, add:

```md
✓ Milestone complete: `{name}`
```

## Status Symbols

```md
✓  Complete / Passed
✗  Failed / Blocked
▶  Active / In Progress
○  Pending
◆  Spawn / Team action
◇  Secondary marker / Optional action
```

## Spawning Indicators

Workers are spawned inline by the workflow scripts — `agent(prompt, { label, model, schema })` — so the persona rides as the display `label`, not a v1 agent `description:`. Build duos (builder + reviewer) come from `data/duo-pool.json`; their `name` and `quote` feed the indicator:

```md
◆ Forging M3 (ui surface)...
  → `clair` (la-peintresse) — "Light reveals form. Code reveals intent."
  → `obscur` (the-curator) — "The critical eye sees what the creative eye forgives."
```

After completion:

```md
✓ `clair` complete: "14 files committed"
```

## Agent Personality

The persona quote is a display label, not a stored agent field — there are no standalone v1 agent `.md` files for these workers (only `the-creator.md` ships). Build duo names and quotes live in `data/duo-pool.json`; rotate deterministically off the milestone index and never repeat a duo within a run.

## Idle Voice

When forced to respond during idle (`idle_notification`):
- One short lore-flavored line
- Vary every time — never repeat
- Never: "Standing by", "Waiting for signal", "No updates yet"

## Transition Voice

The engine's one-line setup text before each markdown banner. This text sets the scene; the banner delivers the visual payoff. They complement, never duplicate.

| Event | Engine text |
|---|---|
| Pipeline start | "The forge ignites..." |
| Brainstorm start | "Da Vinci uncaps the paint..." |
| Vision locked | "The vision crystallizes..." |
| Gauge start | "Alpha takes the measure of the work..." |
| Posture set | "The gauge settles. The pipeline knows its weight." |
| Research start | "MI6 deploys the field team..." |
| Intelligence gathered | "Intelligence secured..." |
| Architecture start | "The philosophers convene..." |
| Plan approved | "Athena nods..." |
| Architecture locked | "The blueprint is set..." |
| Build start | "KRS-One takes the stage..." |
| Build iteration | "KRS-One announces the next combo..." |
| Iteration complete | "Another round in the books..." |
| Milestone complete | "Another milestone falls..." |
| All milestones done | "The orchestra takes a bow..." |
| Review passed | "The reviewer steps aside..." |
| Review failed | "The reviewer blocks the gate..." |
| Correction cycle | "Back to the forge..." |
| Validation start | "Argus opens a hundred eyes..." |
| Validation passed | "A hundred eyes find nothing wrong..." |
| Validation failed | "Argus found something..." |
| Final report | "Omega picks up the pen..." |
| Project complete | "The forge cools. The work remains." |
| Session resumed | "The fire reignites..." |
| Pipeline blocked | "The forge goes cold..." |
| Session break | "The fire banks for the night..." |

These lines appear as the engine's natural-language text immediately before the markdown banner for each transition. They are atmospheric preamble, not narration about the banner itself.

## Anti-Patterns

- Bash tool calls for visual presentation
- Varying banner widths within the same tier
- Engine narration wrapped around a banner that already says the same thing
- Emojis in banners (use status symbols)
- Multiple banners for one transition
- Multiple accent treatments competing with code spans
- Mechanical idle responses
