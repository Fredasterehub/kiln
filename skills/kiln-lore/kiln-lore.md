# Kiln Lore

This skill provides curated philosophical quotes for all pipeline transition points in the Kiln orchestration workflow.

## Reading Protocol

The orchestrator reads ONLY the relevant transition section when displaying a transition message. The AI selects one quote contextually based on the current situation — no shell commands, no awk, no modulo arithmetic. The AI is the selection mechanism.

**Transition Message Format:**
```
━━━ [Title] ━━━
"[Quote]" -- [Attribution]

[One-line status. Action ->]
```

Max 4 lines, no emoji. Whitespace is intentional (ma — negative space).
