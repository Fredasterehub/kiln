# T02-T04: Write vision-sections template

## GOAL
Create the vision-sections.md template that defines the structured sections for VISION.md — produced during the brainstorming phase and locked after operator approval.

## ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA
- AC-03 (DET): `templates/vision-sections.md` exists and contains required sections: problem statement, solution overview, user personas, success criteria, constraints and non-goals, key decisions, open questions

## FILES
- path: templates/vision-sections.md
  action: add
  rationale: Template defining the canonical structure for .kiln/VISION.md output from brainstorming

## COMMANDS
- `test -f templates/vision-sections.md` — file exists
- `grep -c '##' templates/vision-sections.md` — has multiple sections (expect 7+)

## SUMMARY
Create the file `templates/vision-sections.md`. This is a markdown template that defines the canonical structure for `.kiln/VISION.md` — the permanent north-star document produced during kiln's interactive brainstorming phase. The brainstormer agent uses this template as a guide when crystallizing brainstorm output into a structured vision document. After operator approval, VISION.md becomes immutable.

**Context for the implementer:** This is NOT a fill-in-the-blanks template with `{{placeholders}}`. It is a section-guide document: it defines the 7 required sections, explains what belongs in each one, and provides guidance via HTML comments that the brainstormer agent removes when filling in real content. The `templates/` directory already exists. Place this file at `templates/vision-sections.md`.

Write this exact markdown content to the file:

```markdown
# VISION

<!-- This template defines the required sections for .kiln/VISION.md.
     The brainstormer agent fills each section during the brainstorming phase.
     After operator approval, VISION.md becomes immutable.
     If the vision needs to change, re-run /kiln:brainstorm. -->

## Problem Statement

<!-- What problem does this project solve? Who experiences it?
     Why do existing solutions fall short?

     Guidelines:
     - Be specific about the pain points. "It's slow" is not enough.
       "API responses take 3+ seconds because of N+1 queries" is.
     - Identify who suffers from this problem and how often.
     - Cite real limitations of existing approaches.
     - Do NOT describe the solution here — only the problem. -->

## Solution Overview

<!-- High-level description of what we're building.
     How does it address the problem? What is the core value proposition?

     Guidelines:
     - 2-3 paragraphs maximum.
     - Describe WHAT the solution does, not HOW it's implemented.
     - Focus on the value to users, not the technology.
     - Avoid implementation details (languages, frameworks, architecture).
       Those belong in the planning phase. -->

## User Personas

<!-- Who are the primary users? What are their goals, constraints,
     and technical context?

     Guidelines:
     - Define 1-3 personas.
     - Each persona should have:
       - Name and role (e.g., "Alex — Frontend Developer")
       - Goals: what they want to achieve
       - Pain points: what frustrates them today
       - Technical proficiency: beginner / intermediate / expert
     - Personas drive feature prioritization and UX decisions. -->

## Success Criteria

<!-- Measurable outcomes that define "done".
     These become the acceptance criteria that drive the entire pipeline.

     Guidelines:
     - Each criterion must be independently verifiable.
     - Use concrete metrics where possible:
       GOOD: "API response time < 200ms for 95th percentile"
       BAD:  "Fast API"
       GOOD: "User can complete checkout in under 3 clicks"
       BAD:  "Easy checkout flow"
     - Include both functional criteria (features work) and
       non-functional criteria (performance, security, accessibility).
     - Number each criterion (SC-01, SC-02, ...) for traceability. -->

## Constraints and Non-Goals

<!-- Technical constraints and explicit exclusions.

     ### Constraints
     - Platform, language, or framework requirements
     - Performance requirements
     - Compatibility requirements
     - Budget or timeline constraints
     - External dependencies or API limitations

     ### Non-Goals
     - Things we are explicitly NOT building.
     - Non-goals are as important as goals — they prevent scope creep.
     - Be specific about what's excluded AND why.
       GOOD: "No mobile app — web-responsive design covers mobile use cases"
       BAD:  "No mobile" -->

## Key Decisions

<!-- Decisions made during brainstorming that constrain implementation.

     Guidelines:
     - Format each as a decision record:
       **Decision:** What was decided
       **Alternatives considered:** What else was evaluated
       **Rationale:** Why this option was chosen
     - These are binding — implementation must respect them.
     - Examples: technology choices, architecture patterns,
       authentication strategy, data storage approach. -->

## Open Questions

<!-- Unresolved questions that can be answered during implementation.

     Guidelines:
     - Only include genuine unknowns, not things that should have
       been decided during brainstorming.
     - Each question should note:
       - The question itself
       - Why it can't be answered now
       - When it needs to be resolved (which phase/track)
     - Open questions become inputs to the planning phase. -->
```

The document should be ~95 lines. Keep guidance text in HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) so it doesn't render in previews but is visible to the brainstormer agent reading the raw file. Each section heading must be an `##` (H2) under the `#` (H1) title. The brainstormer agent will replace comment blocks with real content while preserving the section headings.

## ESTIMATED_DIFF
~95 lines

## RISKS
- Missing sections would cause the brainstormer to produce incomplete VISION.md files
- Overly rigid structure might constrain creative brainstorming output
- Section names must match what the brainstormer agent references (Track T04)

## ROLLBACK
- git revert <task commit>
